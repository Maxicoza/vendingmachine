# vendingmachine
This vending machine code is a program that mimics using a real vending machine. Users can see what's available, choose items by entering codes, and complete transactions using a simulated money balance. It's a digital version of the familiar vending machine experience, allowing users to select and enjoy their favorite snacks.
This was fun and took a pretty long time to make, hope you enjoy!
